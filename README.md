The Flappy Bird Game in Python is a fun and simple project that uses the pygame library to create a clone of the popular Flappy Bird game.
Game Controls
Spacebar: Press to make the bird flap (move upward).
Close Button: Click to close the game window.
Notes
Images: The code expects specific image files (bird.png, pipe.png, background.png). You can use any images you like, but ensure they match the expected dimensions.
Scoring: You can implement scoring by detecting when the bird passes through the pipes and incrementing a score counter.
Game Over: The game stops when the bird collides with a pipe or the screen boundaries.
This code provides a basic Flappy Bird implementation. You can customize it further by adding more features, such as sound effects, scoring, or improved graphics. Let me know if you'd like more information or help with customization!
